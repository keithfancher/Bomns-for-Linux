= BOMNS FOR LINUX CHANGELOG =
= ------------------------- =

- Changes for 0.99.3:
- bomns
  * Banish the Autotools to the land of wind and ghosts. CMake for the win.
  * Beginnings of netplay, thanks to Charles. See the "netplay" branch.
  * No longer compiles unused/broken AI code

- bomnsedit
  * None

- bomnslauncher
  * GTK1 launcher is archived and no longer built (it sucks, don't worry)
  * bomnslauncher2 renamed bomnslauncher


- Changes for 0.99.2:
- bomns
  * Fixed glitches in intro.bmp, plus improved it overall
  * Fixed stupid buffer overflow problem
  * Changed audio chunk size to fix the sound delay
  * Added a window manager icon
  * Added a desktop entry, so it will appear in your menus after installed
  * Added objects-shiny.bmp (thanks to kulhas from Sourceforge). For now, if
    you want to use the new objects, just copy over the old objects.bmp.
  * More autoconf/automake fixes... it's been YEARS, after all
  * Removed option to compile GTK1 launcher from configure script.
    (It can still be compiled by hand, but it was causing 
    autoconf errors.  And GTK1 is obsolete now anyway.)

- bomnsedit
  * Added a window manager icon

- bomnslauncher
  * None


- Changes for 0.99.1:
-bomns
  * None

-bomnsedit
  * Fixed possible bug with SDL_DisplayFormat

-bomnslauncher
  * Stupid bugfix - I forgot to #include <stdio.h> in
    src/launcher2/callbacks.c and src/launcher2/main.c.  For some reason this
    went totally undetected on my machine.  I am retarded.


- Changes for 0.99:
-bomns
  * Display version string in window caption
  * 20 fps increase!  Now running at at least 60 fps all the time (on my
    machine)
  * Newer better (but bigger) intro screen.  The increased size is well worth
    it.
  * Much better bomn sprite AND pre-explosion number animation
  * Now the filename variable for the level is 512 characters instead of the
    previous 80, which makes much more sense considering there might also be
    an entire path, not just the filename.
  * Changed sounds so they are all 22050hz, 16bit, mono, and Mix_OpenAudio
    actually initializes that way.  Also normalized them all.
  * Many of the sounds are new, and don't violate any kind of copyrights.  Not
    that they, uhh... did before or anything.  Thanks to Charles for the
    "winner.wav" sound, it's much cooler than anything I came up with.
  * Now a random beginning match sound is played, instead of just the same one
    every time
  * Invulnerability sprites have different colored eyes so you can tell them
    apart (sort of)
  * Changed configure.in so at the end of ./configure it tells the user what
    is and isn't being built

-bomnsedit
  * It exists!
  * Pass it a level on the command line, if that level exists it will load it,
    if it doesn't exist it will use that filename to save to
  * If you don't pass it a file name it will use "default.lvl", and start with
    a blank editing space.  This is true even if default.lvl already exists,
    so take care to not overwrite levels if you always use the default
    filename.
  * Use mouse or keyboard to create a level, press F2 to save the level to the
    specified filename
  * Press 'l' to launch the level in Bomns.  It will only work if the "bomns"
    executable is in your path, obviously.  Also note that this will
    automatically save the level before it launches (it has to), so make sure
    you're not doing some un-changable thing before you launch.
  * If you don't want bomnsedit built, pass --disable-editor to ./configure

-bomnslauncher
  * Now there is a MUCH better launcher, built with GTK2, which is compiled by
    default.  The original launcher still exists, if for some reason you want
    to use it.  It's not compiled by default, however, you have to use the
    ./configure option --enable-launcher1 to build it.
  * If you don't want the new launcher built, pass --disable-launcher2 to the
    ./configure script
  

- Changes for 0.98:
  * A better framefrate counter, doesn't fuck up with explosions,
    and it's now on by default
  * ShowFps option in the config file, although not yet in the launcher
  * Doubled the framerate by changing some init code
  * Even more autoconf/automake shenanigans, due to an upgrade to Slackware 10
  * In preparation for the level editor that's coming next version, Bomns
    can now load a level from a file.  First the filename itself is checked, but
    if the level isn't found there the directory prefix/share/bomns/levels
    is checked.  The levels are simple text files that can be easily changed
    without the editor, so feel free to fuck with them
  * Now a prefix/share/bomns/levels directory is created on install, and some 
    (as of now just ONE) example levels are installed there
  * There is now a usage message if you pass incorrect command line options,
    and there's also a new --help option
  * Renamed "launcher" to "bomnslauncher" to help keep things together
  * Added sound for when a player picks up an invulnerability powerup
  * Added code to change where P1 and P2 start, used so a level file can
    specify where the players begin

- Changes for 0.97:
  * Fixed bug where timer disappeared during explosions
  * Made explosions last even LONGER (400 ms now)
  * Changed around some autoconf/automake business to be more
    compatible with newer versions (after my upgrade to 
    Slackware 8.1, and all its new shinyness).
  * Beginnings of an AI system
  * Some cleanups of stupidly implemented things
  * Some new (experimental) sounds (beginning sound, winning
    sound, warp sound)
  * All the autoconf/automake stuff is much cooler.  Now the 
    building of the launcher isn't a separate thing, it's all
    taken care of in the configure script.  If you don't have
    GTK or you --disable-launcher, then the launcher just simply
    won't be built.  Otherwise it will.
  * Moved launcher directory to src/launcher

- Changes for 0.96:
  * Added the option to give matches a time limit
  * Now launcher loads from a config file if there is one
    instead of just automatically loading default settings
  * Bigger (better) launcher
  * Added a _tiny_ bit more error checking when reading in
    the config file values (don't wanna get too stringent)
  * If sound is set to false, it doesn't even MESS with /dev/dsp
  * Changed around the quasi-HUD a bit (added incentive to KILL!)
  * Explosions last longer (300 ms pause between frames intead of
    200 ms)
  * Better explosion sound
  * A quasi framerate counter, not really meant for end user use
  * Changed max seed value in launcher (it still should be bigger...)

- Changes for 0.95:
  * Entire project released under GPL
  * Now the installation is GNU/Linux-afied, with the classic 
    "configure && make && make install" routine
  * Now there's a LoadResource() function that figures out 
    where all the graphics/sounds are so they can be loaded
    correctly

- Changes for 0.9:
  * New sound support via SDL Mixer
  * Fixed the keyboard tapping while bomns exploding bug
  * Fixed a bug with bomns counting down incorrectly
  * More (less important) bugfixes

- Changes for 0.8:
  * Bomns for Linux launcher debut
  * Changed all the printf() error and info messages to 
    fprintf(stderr)'s, thus eliminating the need to run 
    BfL from a console.
  * Changed "startbomns" config value to "p1startbomns"
    and "p2startbomns" so they can be changed independently
  * Tons more optimizations
  * Rewrote Makefile
  * Redid a few of the graphics

- Changes for 0.7:
  * Changed DEF_WALLS to 900
  * Fixed bug with the inifinitely invincible player
  * Added new value "startbomns" to config file 

- Changes for 0.6:
  * Much better intro screen
  * Much better explosions
  * Even MORE bugfixes

- Changes for 0.5:
  * Finally players can set bomns!
  * That means there can now be ties
  * TONS of bugfixes and optimizations

- Changes for 0.4:
  * Intro screen
  * Ability to actually kill the other player
  * Now (of course) score is kept
  * The shiny new win dialog

- Changes for 0.3:
  * Warps implemented
  * Config file

- Changes for 0.2:
  * Quasi-HUD
  * Powerups actually have some effect

- Changes for 0.1:
  * Now it exists
  * You can move around, there's collision detection
    with the walls but not with powerups.
