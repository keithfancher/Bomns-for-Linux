Intro
-----
For a while Bomns, the single greatest game to ever grace a computer,
was confined to people who had DOS and Windows.  Enter me.  I realized
that there are a lot of people out there who have Linux, and that they
NEEDED to play Bomns.  I realize that most Linux users have a Windows
partition somewhere, and they could easily boot into Windows if they
really wanted to play Bomns.  I also realize that's more trouble than
it's worth.  I bring them Bomns for Linux, thus eliminating the need to
boot into Windows, and increasing the chances that somebody'll actaully
play it.  I recommend the first thing you do after seeing if BfL crashes
your computer is to head over to bomns.sourceforge.net where the rest of
the Bomns games are.  I personally recommend Bomns^2, as it's my favorite
of the bunch so far, however I have a feeling that'll change if Charles
Lindsay (the original Bomns pimp) would hurry the Christ up and finish
DXBomns.

NOTE: A new DXBomns was just released, head over to bomns.sourceforge.net
      and check it out.  It's definitely awesome.


System Requirements
-------------------
- Linux (although now it'll probably compile on other unices as well)
- SDL - get the latest version at www.libsdl.org
- SDL mixer - get the latest version at www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/  
- GTK+ 1.2 - for the launcher, if you don't use the launcher
  then you don't need it (but you should use it)
- The header files for those libraries if you're compiling (obviously)
- Another person
- Umm, a keyboard?


Installation
------------
Bomns for Linux just has a regular ol' GNU installation.  Read the
file "INSTALL" for full details, but basically it boils down to:

  ./configure
  make
  make install

I decided after much consideration that I should keep the launcher in a 
separate project from regular ol' Bomns.  For one thing, it makes it MUCH
easier on me, as far as upgrading and stuff goes, but also it doesn't force
you to install the launcher or GTK if you don't want it.  Of course there's
no reason to NOT install the launcher, and probably every Linux in the
universe has GTK nowadays, but still, it's better this way.  After you install
bomns if you want the launcher just cd into the "launcher" subdirectory and
do a ./configure && make && make install.  It doesn't matter where it installs,
as long as the bomns executable is somewhere in your path the launcher will
find it just fine.  You can even make a symlink to the "launcher" binary and
call it "gbomns" or something, I'll leave that up to you.


Note on Sound
-------------
The sound is pretty (really) new, so it might be kind of buggy.  I'd like
everybody to at least try and to report any bugs or incompatibilities,
but if you really just can't stand it any longer you can just turn it off.  
I know the sounds aren't anything spectacular, but please at least try them 
so I can figure out what bugs there are.  I'm not too confident about my 
SDL_mixer skills at this point.


Playing
-------
Bomns is pretty simple, just use arrows for first player, wasd for
second player.  Player 1 lays a bomb with enter, and player 2 lays
a bomb with spacebar.  Oh yeah, and 'f' switches from windowed to
fullscreen mode and the other way around.  Fullscreen is better.  Just 
type "bomns" and you're ready to rock.  Now there's also an optional
timer, it works pretty much like the timer in any standard fighting
game.  If the time ends before anybody's dead, whoever has the most life
wins.  If both players have the same life, it's a tie.  I've grown to like
it, but if you don't then just disable it.


Configuring
-----------
The first time you start Bomns for Linux, a file called "~/.bomnsrc" will
be created.  You can open this up in any text editor and change the
values inside for a bit more customization.  You'll figure it out.
NOTE: Now obsolete!  Use the launcher!
