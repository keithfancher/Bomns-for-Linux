Intro
-----
For a while Bomns, the single greatest game to ever grace a computer,
was confined to people who had DOS and Windows.  Enter me.  I realized
that there are a lot of people out there who have Linux, and that they
NEEDED to play Bomns.  I realize that most Linux users have a Windows
partition somewhere, and they could easily boot into Windows if they
really wanted to play Bomns.  I also realize that's more trouble than
it's worth.  I bring them Bomns for Linux, thus eliminating the need to
boot into Windows, and increasing the chances that somebody'll actaully
play it.  The first thing you should do after seeing if BfL crashes your 
computer is to head over to bomns.sourceforge.net where the rest of the 
Bomns games are.  I personally recommend Bomns^2, as it's my favorite of 
the bunch so far, however I have a feeling that'll change if Charles Lindsay 
(the original Bomns pimp) would hurry the Christ up and finish DXBomns.

NOTE: A new DXBomns was just released, head over to bomns.sourceforge.net
      and check it out.  It's definitely awesome.


System Requirements
-------------------
- Linux (although now it'll probably compile on other unices as well)
- SDL - get the latest version at www.libsdl.org
- SDL mixer - get the latest version at www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/  
- GTK+ 1.2 - for the launcher, if you don't use the launcher
  then you don't need it (but you should use it)
- The header files for those libraries if you're compiling (obviously)
- Another person
- Umm, a keyboard?


Installation
------------
Bomns for Linux just has a regular ol' GNU installation.  Read the
file "INSTALL" for full details, but basically it boils down to:

  ./configure
  make
  make install

This will install a "bomns" binary and a "launcher" binary, and of course all 
the bomns data.  To disable the building of the launcher, just pass the option
--disable-launcher to the configure script (new to version 0.97).


Note on Sound
-------------
The sound is pretty (really) new, so it might be kind of buggy.  I'd like
everybody to at least try and to report any bugs or incompatibilities,
but if you really just can't stand it any longer you can just turn it off.  
I know the sounds aren't anything spectacular, but please at least try them 
so I can figure out what bugs there are.  I'm not too confident about my 
SDL_mixer skills at this point.


Playing
-------
Bomns is pretty simple, just use arrows for first player, 'wasd' for
second player.  Player 1 lays a bomb with enter, and player 2 lays
a bomb with spacebar.  Oh yeah, and 'f' switches from windowed to
fullscreen mode and the other way around.  Fullscreen is better.  Just 
type "bomns" and you're ready to rock.  Now there's also an optional
timer, it works pretty much like the timer in any standard fighting
game.  If the time ends before anybody's dead, whoever has the most life
wins.  If both players have the same life, it's a tie.  I've grown to like
it, but if you don't then just disable it.


Configuring
-----------
The first time you start Bomns for Linux, a file called "~/.bomnsrc" will
be created.  You can open this up in any text editor and change the
values inside for a bit more customization.  You'll figure it out.  Of 
course you really don't HAVE to figure it out, that's what the launcher
is for.
