 ---------------------------
| Bomns for Linux TODO list |
 ---------------------------

-> Level editor
  * bomnsedit <some.lvl>
  * load a text file, so it's editable w/out the editor
  * add LoadFromFile() to level.*
  * bomnsedit compiles seperately
  * navigate with keyboard, choose tiles and p1/p2 start positions
  * have a custom levels section on the website?

-> Make timer text non-red (yellow?)

-> Increase framerates (improve DrawLevel() function?)

-> Network play! (using SDL_net?)

-> Add ability to remap keys

-> Music of some sort?  midi, but midi support on linux is retarded...

-> GTK2 launcher, and the ability to choose which is compiled

-> Eventually do away w/ separate launcher altogether, configure in-game
