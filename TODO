| Bomns for Linux TODO list |
 ---------------------------

-> Level editor
  * editor cursor sprite, a yellow outline of the tile, just to distinguish
  * number keys select tiles, quicker than scrolling
  * have a custom levels section on the website?
  * middle click toggles grid

done  * fix crash when launching bomns while editor is in fullscreen mode (just switch modes first?)
done  * bomnsedit <some.lvl>
done  * load a text file, so it's editable w/out the editor
done  * add LoadFromFile() to level.*
done  * bomnsedit compiles seperately
done  * navigate with keyboard, choose tiles and p1/p2 start positions
done  * mouse navigation, tile is cursor, left click for stamp, right for erase, wheel chooses tile
done  * needlessly object oriented... not sure if creating and destroying Objects on the fly is fast
        or slow, but since it's not the actual GAME, it shouldn't matter, and I want to experiment.
done  * cursor has array of one of every object, and a current index of what kind to use
done  * press something (L?) to launch level in bomns for testing

  
done -> GTK2 launcher, and the ability to choose which is compiled

done -> Much more ominous beginning sound need, something like KIIIIIIIIILLL (growling)

done -> Change autoconf stuff so at the end of ./configure it tells you what is and isn't being built


-> Move entire HUD a few pixels to the right to make everything more centered

-> Make timer font monospaced, would make the new HUD come together better probably

-> Eventually do away w/ separate launcher altogether, configure in-game (fuck this, I think)

-> Make timer text non-red (yellow?)

-> Increase framerates (improve DrawLevel() function?)

-> Network play! (using SDL_net?)

-> Add ability to remap keys

-> Music of some sort?  Midi, but midi support on linux is retarded, and why wouldn't you just play
   an MP3 or CD of your OWN while playing, instead of some retarded-ass midi?  Fuck this too.
