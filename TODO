 ---------------------------
| Bomns for Linux TODO list |
 ---------------------------

-> Level editor
  * bomnsedit <some.lvl>
  * load a text file, so it's editable w/out the editor
  * add LoadFromFile() to level.*
  * bomnsedit compiles seperately
  * navigate with keyboard, choose tiles and p1/p2 start positions
  * mouse navigation, tile is cursor, left click for stamp, right for erase, wheel chooses tile
  * have a custom levels section on the website?
  * needlessly object oriented... not sure if creating and destroying Objects on the fly is fast
    or slow, but since it's not the actual GAME, it shouldn't matter, and I want to experiment.
  * cursor has array of one of every object, and a current index of what kind to use

-> Make timer text non-red (yellow?)

-> Increase framerates (improve DrawLevel() function?)

-> Network play! (using SDL_net?)

-> Add ability to remap keys

-> Music of some sort?  midi, but midi support on linux is retarded...

-> GTK2 launcher, and the ability to choose which is compiled

-> Eventually do away w/ separate launcher altogether, configure in-game
